Stepping into the new age of Industrial Revolution 4.0 offers an opportunity for the globe to rethink the meaning of building information that breaks the territorial borders of building information systems that are not based project-wise but follow a geopolitical structure. It expands the conventional thought process from being limited to a building to a city/ planetary urbanization level. As a response to the new urban design theory, the paper posits an approach that amalgamates “Design for Disassembly (DFD)” and “Digital Twins” which have gained traction because of the “Circular Economy” and “Industrial Revolution 4.0” respectively, to create an information framework for the urban ecology that focuses on system management rather than project management via "Material Passport (MP) 2.0" which is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based serialization of materials to reinstate the material circularity and reduce the carbon emissions that the construction sector accounts for currently.
